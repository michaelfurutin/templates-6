# OttoFeller Projen Templates

## ðŸ›  Development guide
### Installation
Simply install dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

### Synthesize
The app itself is projen template, so it can be synthesized (a code generated out of projen's TS files). Modify the app's template in `.projenrc.ts` and run the following command:
```sh
npx projen
```

> :warning: Normally you should never modify anything other than templates in `src/` dir and `.projenrc.ts`.

### Build
The build is the process of creating [JSII](https://github.com/aws/jsii) artefacts. These are the files required to run `npx projen new --from ...` (JSII is much more powerful technology, but it is out of the scope of this project). The build create/update the `.jsii` file (JSII config):
```sh
npx projen build
```

### Publish

## ðŸ“€ User guide

```
