# {{PROJECT_TITLE}}

The app is created using a [projen](https://projen.io) template from `@ottofeller/templates` package.

## Install new packages

The common approach of installing packages by running `npm install <package-name>` won't work because `npx projen` re-synthesizes all files, including `package.json`.

Follow [these](https://github.com/ottofeller/templates?tab=readme-ov-file#install-new-packages) instructions to install new packages.

## Update the template

Updating projen template can result in signifcant changes in the components of the template.

Follow [these](https://github.com/ottofeller/templates?tab=readme-ov-file#update-a-project) instructions to update `@ottofeller/template` in the repo.

## Eject

To get rid of projen in the project follow [these](https://github.com/ottofeller/templates?tab=readme-ov-file#update-a-project) instructions.
